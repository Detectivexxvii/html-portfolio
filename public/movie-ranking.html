<h1>The Best Movie According to Tristan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
The casts performance is spot on in this film. David Fincher's use of an appropriate amount of cinematography.
    The quotability and new things to be found in each watch makes it quite the onion to unravel.</p>
<h3>Princess Monoke</h3>
<p>Studio Ghibli is second to none when it comes to immersive, captivating, palatable anime movies for all.
    Later in life I realized how many of my morals were based off of the main prtagonistst actions.
    The themes of nature, responsibility, and understanding are the focus of the film without bogging down the tale.</p>
<h3>Se7en</h3>
<p>Another great film by David Fincher. a creepy film noir tale of a serial killer fullfilling a project leading to grizzly outcomes.
    the dialogue and mood of each scene is very captivating and engaging.</p>
